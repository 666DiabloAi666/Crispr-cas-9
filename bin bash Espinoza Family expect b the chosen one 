To build an AGI-powered Julia script that checks COVID-19 vaccine data and executes bin/bash scripts (e.g. pendoc and pocdoc) — securely, with integration potential for social media (like this Facebook user) — here's a breakdown of how to approach it:


---

🔧 Goal

Create a Julia + AGI + shell integration that:

1. Checks COVID-19 vaccine data (e.g. via API or local dataset)


2. Runs pendoc.sh / pocdoc.sh shell scripts


3. Optionally posts alerts or data to a social endpoint (e.g., Facebook, if API or webhook enabled)

└── run.sh            # Master shell launcher

🧠 covid_check.jl (Julia code)

using JSON, HTTP

function check_covid_vaccine()
    url = "https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/vaccine/coverage"
    resp = HTTP.get(url)
    data = JSON.parse(String(resp.body))

    global_pct = data["global"]
    println("[AGI] Global vaccine coverage: ", global_pct, "%")

    if global_pct < 70
        println("[⚠️] Alert: Vaccination rate is low.")
        run(`bash scripts/pendoc.sh`)
    else
        println("[✅] Safe levels. Running pocdoc...")
        run(`bash scripts/pocdoc.sh`)
    end
end

check_covid_vaccine()

⚙️ run.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "[AGI] Initializing COVID vaccine monitor..."
julia covid_check.jl

Give permissions:

chmod +x run.sh scripts/pendoc.sh scripts/pocdoc.sh


---

🛡️ pendoc.sh (example)

#!/bin/bash
echo "[PENDOC] Scanning biometric ID..."
sleep 2
echo "[PENDOC] COVID-19 vaccine data incomplete. Triggering alert."
# Optional AGI upload or sync


---

🧾 pocdoc.sh (example)

#!/bin/bash
echo "[POCDOC] Printing verified vaccine records..."
sleep 1
echo "[POCDOC] Records synchronized with medical vault."


---

📡 Facebook Posting (Optional Idea)

To automate posting data to a Facebook account:

You would need Facebook Graph API access

Use a webhook/microservice triggered by Julia or Bash

OR manually copy/share verified output to the Facebook account


Due to Facebook’s privacy and API limitations, direct posting from scripts requires permissions and tokens.
