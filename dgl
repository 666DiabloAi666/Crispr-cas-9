System Overview

Core Modules (interconnected):

1. DNA Simulation Engine (Rust)


2. AI Genome Strategist (Python - FastAPI + ML)


3. Ethical Guard Module (Rust + Python rules engine)


4. Cas9 Virtual Assistant (LLM-Driven)


5. Mutation Forecasting Engine (Python ML)


6. Genome Visualization UI (React + WebGL)


7. Hybrid Control Center (Rust orchestrator)




---

1. DNA Simulation Engine (Rust)

High-performance simulator of genetic sequences

Can model genome structures, transcription/translation, off-target effects

Allows injecting mutations (real or pseudo)

Includes APIs for:

Sequence input/output

Cas9 target binding simulation

Resultant protein prediction



Tech: Rust, actix-web, serde, wasm (for optional Web UI link)


---

2. AI Genome Strategist (Python ML)

Decides where to cut/edit genomes

Learns from past edits

Predicts outcomes of CRISPR edits using:

Transformer-based sequence models

RNNs for gene regulatory networks



Capabilities:

Suggest CRISPR targets

Score off-target risks

Recommend edits for traits (in simulation)


Tech: FastAPI, scikit-learn, Transformers (HuggingFace), Pandas, NumPy


---

3. Ethical Guard Module

Rule-based system to prevent unethical edits

Uses:

Hardcoded genetic ethics policies (e.g., no germline human edits)

Self-updating policy database

Logs all decisions and flags dangerous edits



Tech: Python rules engine (e.g., durable_rules, PyKnow), Rust for enforcement, SQLite audit log


---

4. Cas9 Virtual Assistant (LLM)

Natural language interface

Can explain DNA sequences, suggest edits

Warns users about biological or ethical risks

Offers educational interaction


Tech: GPT-like model (fine-tuned on bio/genetics), integrated via FastAPI or LangChain


---

5. Mutation Forecasting Engine

Predicts downstream effects of genome edits

Uses generative ML models + knowledge graphs

Traces possible phenotypes or protein malfunctions


Tech: Graph neural networks, BioBERT, DGL, PyTorch


---

6. Genome Visualization UI

3D genome editor and visualizer

Sequence maps, protein models, cut locations

Logs simulation steps in real-time


Tech: React, Three.js, WebAssembly for Rust interop


---

7. Hybrid Control Center (Rust Orchestrator)

Coordinates Python AI, DNA engine, and UI

Manages tasks, workflows, state

Provides CLI + HTTP API + Web dashboard

Advanced Features

Offline Mode with WASM: Runs locally in browser

Self-Evolving AI: Adds its own genome editing techniques over time

Bio-Plausible Sim Mode: Uses datasets from NCBI/Ensembl to simulate real organisms



---

Security + Ethics

Secure sandboxed DNA edits

Tamper-proof logging

Rejects known biohazard patterns

"Safe simulation mode" for public use

Next Steps

1. Audit current GitHub codebase structure


2. Set up Python FastAPI + Rust interface (via FFI or HTTP)


3. Implement the DNA engine and mock genome


4. Add LLM interface


5. Build a visual genome UI


6. Connect ML pipelines
