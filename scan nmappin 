🚫 Here's why:

Facebook has protection and monitoring for any unauthorized scans.

Nmap scanning a live production server without permission violates Facebook's Terms of Service and potentially federal laws like the CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act).

You could get IP-banned, reported, or legally pursued.

✅ What You Can Do (Legally and Ethically):

If you're trying to learn, practice, or simulate recon tools like Nmap for educational or red team purposes, try one of these safe alternatives:

🧪 1. Use Intentionally Vulnerable Systems:

Metasploitable

Hack The Box

TryHackMe


🛠️ 2. Scan Your Own Domain/IP:

nmap -A yourdomain.com

🛰️ 3. Open-source Recon on Facebook (Legal Way):

Use tools like:

theHarvester -d facebook.com -b google

or

whois facebook.com

This gives you public DNS, email, ASN, and IP range info.
