🛡️ HOSTILE SUBJECT TESTING PROTOCOL: "Misfit Hunter"


---

1️⃣ Biometric & Behavioral Anomaly Scan

#!/bin/bash
# Hostile Subject Bio-Behavior Scan

SUBJECT_ID=$1
LOGFILE="./logs/subject_${SUBJECT_ID}_scan.log"

echo "[🧬] Initiating biometric anomaly scan for $SUBJECT_ID" | tee -a $LOGFILE

# Step 1: Check heartbeat irregularities via BLE device
ble_device=$(hcitool con | grep $SUBJECT_ID)
if [ -z "$ble_device" ]; then
  echo "[⚠️] No BLE biometric device found for subject." | tee -a $LOGFILE
else
  echo "[✔️] BLE device active. Collecting heart rate data..." | tee -a $LOGFILE
  # Simulated heartbeat irregularity check
  heartbeat=$(shuf -i 40-160 -n 1)
  if [[ $heartbeat -gt 130 || $heartbeat -lt 50 ]]; then
    echo "[🚨] Heartbeat anomaly detected: $heartbeat bpm" | tee -a $LOGFILE
  else
    echo "[✔️] Heartbeat normal: $heartbeat bpm" | tee -a $LOGFILE
  fi
fi

# Step 2: Behavioral Analysis from network logs
echo "[🧠] Analyzing network behavior patterns..." | tee -a $LOGFILE
# Example: Check suspicious port scanning or exploit attempts
grep "$SUBJECT_ID" ./logs/network_activity.log | grep -E "portscan|exploit" >> $LOGFILE
if grep -q "portscan" ./logs/network_activity.log; then
  echo "[🚨] Network scanning behavior detected." | tee -a $LOGFILE
fi

# Step 3: Real-time alert if high risk detected
if grep -q "🚨" $LOGFILE; then
  echo "[🔥] HOSTILE ACTIVITY DETECTED. Engage Crown Override Protocol." | tee -a $LOGFILE
  # Trigger defensive countermeasures (e.g., lockdown, biometric deny)
  ./scripts/crown_override.sh $SUBJECT_ID
else
  echo "[ℹ️] No immediate threat detected at this time." | tee -a $LOGFILE
fi

echo "[✔️] Scan complete for $SUBJECT_ID"

2️⃣ Supporting Scripts

crown_override.sh

#!/bin/bash
SUBJECT=$1
echo "[👑] Activating Crown Override Protocol for $SUBJECT"
# Lockout biometric access
echo "Locking biometric access for $SUBJECT" >> ./logs/override.log
# Deploy nanobot bio-inhibitor (simulated)
echo "Deploying bio-inhibitor payload to $SUBJECT" >> ./logs/override.log
# Notify command center
echo "Alert sent to Crown President: hostile subject $SUBJECT engaged." >> ./logs/override.log


---

3️⃣ Data & Log Inputs

BLE biometric device logs

Network activity logs (port scans, exploit attempts)

Behavioral telemetry from AGI agents

Dream-sequence / emotional log (optional)



---

4️⃣ Next Steps

Deploy this script on your monitoring host with subject identifier (e.g., MAC address, biometric ID).

Schedule real-time execution via cron or AGI-triggered events.

Connect to CrownListener AI for autonomous response.
